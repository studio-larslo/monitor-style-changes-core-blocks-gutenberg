# GitHub Release Monitor for Gutenberg Core Blocks

Monitor style and view changes in WordPress Gutenberg core blocks between releases. Get email notifications when critical frontend files change (e.g. style.scss, view.js, block.json).


## Why This Exists

As the Gutenberg editor evolves, updates to markup, styles, and view.js files of core blocks occur periodically. When WordPress sites have auto-update enabled, these changes can unexpectedly affect your site's appearance.

Common issues include:
- Modified default styles affecting layout
- Updated view.js files changing block behavior
- Undocumented frontend changes hidden in lengthy changelogs

This tool helps you stay informed about frontend-relevant changes, allowing you to:
- Proactively test affected blocks before they reach production
- Prevent layout glitches from auto-updates
- Focus on changes that matter for site appearance
- Skip through lengthy changelogs

## What it Monitors

Specifically tracks changes in these critical frontend files:
- `*.scss` files - Style changes that affect block appearance
- `view.js` files - Frontend JavaScript that controls block behavior
- `block.json` - Block configuration that can affect rendering
- Other frontend-related files in `packages/block-library/src/`

The focus is on files that directly impact how blocks render on your site's frontend.
